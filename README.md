# Baudelaire Poem Generator
#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Objective
The purpose of this project is inspired by the [famous Karpathy's article](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/), I used a charRNN model with Tensorflow 2 and Keras to generate Baudelaire-like poems. 

### Methods Used
* Web Scraping
* Deep Learning with Tensorflow 2 and Keras
* NLP text preprocessing techniques: regex, tokenizer,...

### Technologies
* Python, Jupyter
* BeautifulSoup, requests
* Tensorflow, Keras, Numpy
* Matplotlib

## Getting Started

# Setup
Follow these commands to generate a poem if you have minimal experience coding/etc. Open up a terminal and use

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ThomasDelatte/baudelaire-poem-generator.git
cd baudelaire-poem-generator
```

Install Python requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And then run using

```bash

```

Then open your browser to `localhost:8000` to see the poetry generator.

1. Clone this repo.
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
